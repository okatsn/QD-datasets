## CHECKPOINT

### Magnitude of Completeness

There are Magnitude of Completeness ($M_c$) contains the following three following methods:
- Maximum Curvature (MAXC): Finding the magnitude bin with the highest frequency of events.
- Goodness-of-Fit Test (GFT): Comparing the observed frequency-magnitude distribution to a synthetic Gutenberg-Richter distribution.
- b-value Stability: Calculating b-values for different cut-off magnitudes to see where they stabilize.
